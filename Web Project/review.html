                        <p >Boba Cutea in East Mesa has quickly become a family favorite! We love the broad range of options as well as the opportunity to modify the amount of ice, sugar and milk type in the beverages! This place is also adorable on the inside! It’s the perfect setting for a tween hangout or celebration, with its cloud lights and pretty trees. </p>

                            <p>First time here visiting from
                                Seattle and it is such a cute atmosphere! Definitely worth a try. Only had the mango green tea for now with the boba. Brown sugar boba a bit chewy/ soft that melts more so I think they just cook it longer which is fine. The mango tea had mango bits in it which are yummy! & the decor is so cute and adorable. Swing by to try it out yourself!</p>

                            <p>This place has great welcoming vibes! There’s so much to choose from the menu! Not only that but they have food as well, they also have dessert! It’s so cute and well decorated inside. The drinks were really good, we got the strawberry milk tea and boba cheesecake. The strawberry milk tea was not over sweet and the cheesecake tasted so good! Definitely coming here a lot more.</p>
